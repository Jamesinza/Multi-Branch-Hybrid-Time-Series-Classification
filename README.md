# Dynamic-Ensemble-Creation
In this experiment the idea is to create numerous random models that are diverse enough to produce different errors during inference. We don't necessarily want model that are diverse in terms of error magnitude but produce reasonably good overall results. Instead, we want the models to make different mistakes when given the same sample to process.
